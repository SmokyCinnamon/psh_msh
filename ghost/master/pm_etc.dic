//---------------------------Miscellaneous Functions--------------------------

//This .dic file is concerned with a number of functions that didn't quite fit in anywhere else. If you're adding new functions, this may be the place to do it! This also has the functions related to updating your ghost, among others. Most of this will just be replacing placeholder dialogue with dialogue more appropriate for your ghost, and this file is fairly long. On the positive side, you'll probably only have to go through it once.
//Make sure to read the walkthrough page (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!

Also for my own reference in the future since I plan on using this template too, haha. If you have no interest in any of this and just want to keep things as simple as possible, feel free to skip these boxes.

//If you want to set up your ghost to check your mail so you can more easily check these messages instead of just writing the dialogue and moving on, it's a little bit tricky, but not super hard.
//Basically, you're going to need to find your POP settings for your email account. Googling your provider + POP should bring it up pretty quick. Once you have the info, you'll go to the right click menu, options, then preferences. A big menu should pop up, and you should see POP in the left side.

 //The following functions are for the Network Update of your ghost, where it will connect to your website, check for new files, and update itself. This is a handy feature, but tricky to set up. If you have no intention of using Network Update, you can disregard these, but it won't hurt to fill them out anyway just in case. More details about how to set up Network Update are in the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html).
 
 //Replace the dialogue in the next set of functions as appropriate. You can easily test these messages using the Developer panel. Go to Open at the bottom of it and choose one of the four Update Event options to simulate a Ghost's update process. I highly recommend doing this at LEAST once if you're going to use this feature to make sure it flows well.

 
 //---- OnUpdateBegin -------------------------------------------------------------

			//reference0 here storing the number of new files. You don't have to use it if you don't want to.
 }}}

//When the ghost has finished the update process.

OnUpdateComplete {

Select.opencl

}}}


 //---- OnUpdate.OnDownloadBegin ------------------------------------------------
 //This dialogue plays when they begin downloading a new file. WARNING: if you have big plans for your ghost and are going to make a lot of new image files for it (like... i do, cough) at some point, you're going to want to make these messages very brief, if you even have them at all. The reason is because the user will see these messages for EVERY individual file that they have to download, and if you have, say, 50 pna files in the queue, they will see this dialogue 50 times. Not only that, but displaying the dialogue takes some time, so it also extends the download process.
 //If you aren't planning on adding a ton of files at any point, or are only intending to update the .dic files which will be at most a handful of files, then you can go ahead and put a short message in here. But if your ghost is going to grow in leaps and bounds as you work on it, try and keep these messages as brief as possible to make the process that much faster for your user.
 
OnUpdate.OnDownloadBegin {
	case nowmode {

		}
		others {
 	if "aitalk" _in_ reference0 //this is checking to see what kind of files are being downloaded. In this case, it's looking for files called aitalk in the download queue. If you want to have a specialized bit of dialogue for each type of file, you can expand this with elseifs and by replacing aitalk with whatever file you have in mind. Keep in mind my warning above though.
 	{
 		//"\0\s[0]We're gonna have more to talk about.\w8\1\s[10]It's in the aitalk file.\e"

 //---- OnUpdate.OnMD5CompareBegin ---------------------------------------------------
 //This checks the hash value of the files in the directory and the files listed in updates.dau, I believe. It will do this for every file the user downloads, so I again remind you of my warning above! For every file they download, they will have to go through three sets of unique dialogue, and it can get old fast. Not to mention it slows things down a lot. Again, I would recommend keeping this very brief, if not just replacing it with "..." instead.

 //**** Headlines and RSS Feeds *********************************************************
 //This section has to do with the RSS feeds option on your ghost. If you drag and drop a url on them, they'll add it to a list you can access via the right-click menu, and they'll tell you the last set of updates for the site. This works best with RSS feeds I think, but you can experiment with other sites to see how it works.
 //The headlines you see under the tab are in the headline folder under your base SSP install. So it'd be SSP\headlines. You should see the folders for each linked headline in there. I've very rarely ever messed with them or used them. Likewise, your RSS feeds you've added will be under SSP\rss and I don't think that option will appear in the headlines/RSS tab until you add an RSS feed to a ghost. If you want to clear your RSS feeds or headlines, just delete either of those two folders.

//**** Ghost Creation and Updating ******************************************************

It's unlikely that anyone other than you will see these messages, but you should be thorough and replace them anyway.
//Primarily, you will see these messages when you're creating your updates file or updating your ghost.nar file. More on this on the walkthrough page. However, you could potentially drag and drop another ghost's folder onto them, and they'll also create a nar for that as well, though I've never done that myself. I really wouldn't mess around too much with this. Just follow the directions on the walkthrough page and fill out the dialogue here as required.
