> zi if you're reading this i said in my code and i will say it again: i love u
> so halfway through gettiing this update finally fucking FINISHED my computer died and i lost practically all of my work. i am not upset about this. i dont know why you would think that. this is not me being upset about this.

> fixed an extra "go back" button in misha's dialogue. not too sure what was up with that
> changed it so that a certain two variables aren't just added together on boot anymore. (they're on the hour now, too.) maybe your relationship dialogue will be more dynamic! idk who knows
> speaking of, as an aside, you can give things to misha to make him like you again. that should fix things.
> fixed some typos
> set the relationship level a little higher in firstboot to give you a little wiggle room (just a *little*.)
> fixed an extra ending parentheses in pasha's stat menu
> fixed some time intervals not working right
> may have added more dialogue tbh i don't remember

> fixed a block comment missing the ending */
> fixed a missing slash in uninstall dialogue

> added like 5 new lines of dialogue.
> added a line in the update complete dialogue to direct you here for notes! hello)

> you won't see this either but added in a way to actually efficiently code in russian. find & replace ily
> added a BUNCH of proper surfaces, mostly just for petting and stuff
> removed a line where they would assume that the other ghost's name was what they said. only really applies for ghosts they won't recognize. which would happen to be most of them, but still
> i lied i added a lot more dialogue
> on that note I added some really cool stuff but you have to go read the disclaimer thing over in pasha's menu. it's important PLEASE READ IT otherwise you will NOT get stuff that you may want to see.
> deleted most of what i put in the readme so that it's less long. here's hoping i didn't delete anything important...

> gave pasha's blink & talk frames the proper outlines (note that they're still not entirely fixed.)
> switched who was saying what in a certain line of winter dialogue to be more in-character
