<---- Release Notes ---->

v1.0.2 -- typos, mostly
> fixed a wait tag in boot dialogue missing a "\"
> fixed certain variables not being set on first boot and therefore being broken
> fixed a comma loading in pasha's text box when checking misha's stats
> added back to menu options for Misha's menus
> fixed a migrated period in the "if the world was ending, what would you do?" dialogue.
> fixed the "(soft hair)" pet dialogue for misha missing an \f tag
> fixed variables being broken for users who do not want to download them a third time. open pasha's menu and click on "stat check" and it should be fine probably.
> gave pasha's blink & talk frames the proper outlines (note that they're still not entirely fixed.)
> switched who was saying what in a certain line of winter dialogue to be more in-character
> many \w tag changes. mostly just taking them out, but also increasing some of them by one, if you were wondering @-@
> they should recognixe if you have cheerybot out now
> added 8 new lines of dialogue
> finally added pat variables. *pat pat*

V1.0.1 -- literally just a extra bracket that needed to be deleted. whoops.
> extra bracket in string.dic got deleted

V1.0 -- released! this is amazing because it's not likely to happen.

<---- About ---->
//these two were mostly only made for me, but in spite of that, they made their way onto your computer!
//wow
//if you're here because of the comic, also wow. sorry jihae is not my favorite character i think i made her second. anyways misha is a friend of pasha's and depending on how the comic goes, you'll see a bit more about him in time

//they do the standard ghost template stuff, and being my second ghost and put together in a weekend, they're a bit disorganized. any look in aitalk will certainly tell you that
can't you just clean your code?
//no
//unfortunately i do not want to and therefore will not
//eventually there will be very big spoilers for the  comic but i feel that's a long  way off yet, in the coding at least. technically this is already a spoler
//sorry comic gang

//if you don't know what I'm talking about, i have a comic called Project HOPE over on tapas. it's cool. you should read it.
//please
//i want people invested in it while i forget about updating for half a year
