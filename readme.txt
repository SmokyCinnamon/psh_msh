//these two were mostly only made for me, but in spite of that, they made their way onto your computer!
//wow
//if you're here because of the comic, also wow. sorry jihae is not my favorite character i think i made her second. anyways misha is a friend of pasha's and depending on how the comic goes, you'll see a bit more about him in time

//they do the standard ghost template stuff, and being my second ghost and put together in a weekend, they're a bit disorganized. any look in aitalk will certainly tell you that
can't you just clean your code?
//no
//unfortunately i do not want to and therefore will not
//eventually there will be very big spoilers for the  comic but i feel that's a long  way off yet, in the coding at least. technically this is already a spoler
//sorry comic gang

//if you don't know what I'm talking about, i have a comic called Project HOPE over on tapas. it's cool. you should read it.
//please
//i want people invested in it while i forget about updating for half a year
